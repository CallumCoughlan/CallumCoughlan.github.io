            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a recent software engineering graduate from Carleton University looking to begin a career. 
                With over 3 years of experience working with tech companies during my degree. I am currently working on getting 
                certified for cloud development with the AZ900. Iâ€™m also currently working on adding Rust to the languages 
                I know how to code in as an at home project.

                Outside of my professional experiences I am a volleyball player, cyclist, tennis player, and gamer.
